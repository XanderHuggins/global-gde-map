**Repository structure**:
- `/01-GDE-mapping-scripts` : this folder contains the **core** scripts used to produce the global GDE map. Scripts are variously written in R and in JavaScript for scripts executed in Google Earth Engine. Scripts written in JavaScript are provided in Rich Text file format. **This folder contains its own readme file.**
- `/02-post-hoc-analysis-scripts` : this folder contains the preprocessing and analysis scripts used to perform post-hoc analysis of the GDE map produced in the `/01-GDE...` folder. 

Source data, and dditional scripts, such as plotting scripts, can be made available upon request. <br>
